This page shows you how to manage a function, should you need to edit the function or verify/change its deployment parameters after creation.

<Macro id="iam-requirements" />

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway console](https://console.scaleway.com)
  - You have [created a function](/serverless/functions/how-to/create-a-function/)
</Message>


1. Click **Functions** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The functions page displays.
2. Click the relevant functions namespace.
3. Click the name of the function you want to manage.
4. Check or edit any of the information as required, in the **Enter function code** section:
    - **Handler**: The functions handler.
    - **Function runtime**: The runtime and version to use for your function.
    - **Function code**: The code of your function. You can either enter it directly using the inline code editor or import it from a ZIP file.
5. Click **Deploy function** to save any changes you have made.

    - Enter your **function code**. 
      - Set the handler for your function.
      - Choose the latest Python version as a .
      - Choose to either use the inline code editor to edit your code directly from your browser in the box provided, or to upload a `*.zip` archive.
    - Choose a **name** for your function, and optionally a **description**. The name must only contain alphanumeric characters.
    - Choose the **resources** to be allocated to your function at runtime. These define the performance characteristics of your function.
    - Set your **scaling** preferences, or leave them at default values. The Scaleway platform autoscales the number of available instances of your function to match the incoming load, depending on the settings you define here.
    - Define any **environment variables** you want to inject into your function. For each environment variable, click **+Add** and enter the key/value pair.
    - Set secret environment variables (optional). **Secrets** are environment variables which are injected into your function and stored securely, but not displayed in the console after initial validation. Add a **key** and a **value**.
    - Set the desired **privacy policy** for your function. This defines whether a function can be executed anonymously (**public**) or only via an authentication mechanism provided by the [Scaleway API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/serverless-functions/#authentication) (**private**).
    - Click **Advanced Options** if you wish to set a custom timeout for your function.
