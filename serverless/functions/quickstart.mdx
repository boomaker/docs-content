The Scaleway [Serverless Functions platform](https://www.scaleway.com/en/serverless-functions/) makes your functions available, executes them on demand and manages resource allocation for you. A function is a lightweight unit of logic, that defines a procedure for changing one element into another. The function remains static, while the variables that pass through it can vary. We show you how to create a functions namespace, create your function, invoke it and delete it when you no longer need it.

<Message type="tip">
  This page explains how to deploy a basic Python function using the Scaleway Console. For advanced usage (ex: larger projects with dependencies, automation, multiple functions...) [several ways to deploy functions](/serverless/functions/reference-content/deploy-function/) are available.

  For real-world examples check out our [scaleway/serverless-examples repository](https://github.com/scaleway/serverless-examples).

## How to create a functions namespace

1. Click **Functions** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The functions page displays.

2. Click **Create namespace**. The functions namespace creation wizard displays.

3. Complete the following steps in the wizard: 

    - Enter a **name** and optionally a **description** for your namespace. The first character of your namespace must be a letter. It can only contain letters, numbers, and dashes. No other special characters are permitted. The namespace is case-sensitive and cannot be edited after its creation.

    - Choose a **region**, which is the geographical location in which your namespace will be deployed.

    - (Optionally) Enter any **environment variables** required for your namespace. Environment variables configured in a namespace will be available in all functions/apps within the same namespace. For each environment variable, click **+ Add new variable** and enter the key/value pair.

4. Click **Create namespace** to finish.
    
    Your namespace is now created and you are taken to its **Functions** tab.

## How to create a function

1. Click **Functions** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The functions page displays.

2. Click the functions namespace you want to use to create your function.

3. Click **Create function**. The function creation wizard displays.

4. Enter your **function code**: 

    - Leave the `handler.handle` default value.

    - Choose the latest Python version as a runtime.

    - Copy and paste the following code in the **Inline code editor**.

        ```Python
        def handle(event, context):

          return {
              "body": "Hello World From Scaleway Functions",
              "headers": {
                  "Content-Type": ["text/plain"],
              }
          }
        ```

    - Choose a **name** for your function, and optionally a **description**. The name must only contain lowercase alphanumeric characters and dashes.

    - Choose the smallest **resources** to be allocated to your function at runtime. These define the performance characteristics of your function.

    - Set your **scaling** preferences, or leave them at default values. The Scaleway platform autoscales the number of available instances of your function to match the incoming load, depending on the settings you define here.

    - Set the **Function privacy policy** to public.

        <Message type="note">
          Public functionc can be executed anonymously. Set the policy to private to [secure your function](/serverless/functions/how-to/secure-a-function/) with an authentication mechanism provided by the [Scaleway API](https://www.scaleway.com/en/developers/api/serverless-functions/#authentication).
        </Message>

    - Verify the **estimated cost**.

5. Click **Create function** to start the function deployment process.

  <Message type="note">
    During the deployment process your function will be executed in a Scaleway environment, if a dependency is missing or
    there are errors in the code you can check for function logs.

## How to delete a function

1. Click **Functions** in the **Serverless** section of the side menu. The functions page displays.

2. Click the relevant functions namespace.

3. Click the <Icon name="more" /> icon next to the function you want to delete, and select **Delete** from the dropdown menu.

4. Type **DELETE** in the pop-up that asks you to confirm the action, then click **Delete function**.

    <Message type="tip">
      You can also delete a function from the [Function settings tab](/serverless/functions/how-to/manage-a-functions-namespace/).
