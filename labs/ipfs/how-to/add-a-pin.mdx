Scaleway IPFS pinning allows you to permanently store a copy of your data from the public IPFS network on a Scaleway-owned node. That way, your data remains available and accessible even when your local machine is offline.

<Message type="requirement">
  - You have an account and are logged into the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com/)
  - You have downloaded and installed [IPFS Desktop App](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/ipfs-desktop/)
  - You have added data to your own local node and retrieved its CID
</Message>

## How to pin your data

1. Click **IPFS Pinning** in the **Labs** section of the [Scaleway Console](https://console.scaleway.com) side menu. The IPFS Pinning section displays.
2. Click the <Icon name="[seeMore]" /> icon next to your desired volume. The **Pins** section displays.
3. Click **Add Pin** to add a pin to your data. A pop-up displays, prompting you to enter the data's information.
4. Enter the CID of your data as well as a name for it.
5. Click **Submit**. The CID and name of your data appears under the **Pins** section. 

## How to retrieve your data 

Now that you have pinned your data, you can retrieve it using [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/), [Pinata](https://www.pinata.cloud/) or [Protocol Labs](https://protocol.ai/). These are IPFS gateways, which are services that allow you to interact with the IPFS network using regular, HTTP/HTTPS web protocols. This means you don't need a particular IPFS software to retrieve your data - you can instead use your regular web browser.

1. Click the <Icon name="[more]" /> icon next to the CID of the data you want to retrieve. The three IPFS gateways display.
2. Click the IPFS gateway you wish to retrieve your data from. Your data displays in a new tab.
