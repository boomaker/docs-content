## Introduction

In the [previous tutorial](/tutorials/set-up-triggers-functions-environment/index.mdx), you learned how to set up your environment to use Serverless Functions with triggers in order to resize images from a bucket and push them to another one.

You should have:

- A Scaleway project dedicated to this tutorial
- A source bucket containing images
- An empty destination bucket
- An SQS queue with credentials
- IAM credentials to secure our environment
- Cockpit enabled to monitor your functions

You will now learn how to deploy Serverless Functions and connect them using triggers.
